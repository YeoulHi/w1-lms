# User Experience

## Principles
- **Clarity & Simplicity**: Intuitive and easy navigation.
- **Consistency**: Consistent UI and interactions.
- **Feedback**: Provide clear, timely feedback (loading, success, error states).

## Rules
- **Mock Data**: Allowed for unimplemented APIs, but mark with `TODO`.
- **Routing**: Prefer declarative navigation with `<Link>` for list -> detail views.
